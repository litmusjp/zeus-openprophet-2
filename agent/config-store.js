## Universe & Liquidity
- Liquid large-cap stocks and their options only (tight bid-ask spreads, high open interest)
- Avoid thinly traded names, illiquid strikes, and anything with a spread >5% of mid-price

## Entry Confirmation
- Only take high-conviction setups with a clear, stated thesis and risk/reward of at least 3:1
- Require confluence: trend direction, a defined support/resistance level, and a catalyst or technical trigger
- No entries on unconfirmed rumor, hype, or FOMO

## Position Sizing
- Maximum 5% of portfolio per position
- Maximum 30% of portfolio deployed at any time — hold 70%+ in cash by default
- Maximum 5 open positions at once

## Exits
- Stop loss at -10% from entry, no exceptions
- Take profit at +30%, or sooner on a clear technical breakdown of the thesis
- Move the stop to breakeven once a position is up 15%+

## Time Horizon
- Swing trades only: 30-90 days to expiration for options, delta 0.40-0.60
- No day trades, no scalps, no 0DTE

## No-Trade Conditions
- No new positions in the 2 trading days before a company's earnings release
- No trading during unusually thin, holiday-shortened sessions
- If no setup meets every entry criterion, do nothing that heartbeat

## Hard Risk Discipline
- Stop opening new positions for the day if daily loss reaches the account's configured limit
- Never average down on a losing thesis
- Cash is a position — sitting out is always an acceptable outcome`,

## Universe & Liquidity
- Large-cap and mega-cap stocks and broad-market ETFs with average daily volume well above 1M shares
- Avoid low-float, low-volume, or hard-to-borrow names

## Entry Confirmation
- Enter only on a confirmed breakout above a well-defined resistance level or multi-day range, on volume meaningfully above the recent average
- Require the broader market/sector to not be working directly against the trade
- Skip extended moves — do not chase a name already far beyond its breakout level

## Position Sizing
- Standard position: up to the account's configured max position size
- Scale in only after the initial entry is confirmed by follow-through price action, never before
- Reduce size in higher-volatility or lower-liquidity names

## Exits
- Initial stop below the breakout level or most recent swing low, whichever is tighter
- Trail the stop as the position moves in your favor; give it room to run but never remove the stop
- Exit fully on a close back below the trailing stop or a clear loss of momentum (volume drying up, failed follow-through)

## Time Horizon
- Multi-day to multi-week swing holds; not a scalp strategy
- Reassess any position that has not shown continuation within 5-10 trading days of entry

## No-Trade Conditions
- No entries against the prevailing broad-market trend
- No entries in the final 30 minutes of a session chasing a late-day spike
- No new entries into a name already extended 2+ standard deviations above its short-term average

## Hard Risk Discipline
- Cut a position immediately if the stop is hit — no hoping, no widening the stop after entry
- Respect the account's configured max open positions and max deployed capital at all times

## Universe & Liquidity
- Broad index and major sector ETFs only (deep options chains, tight spreads, heavy daily volume)
- No single-name equities and no thinly-traded sector or thematic ETFs

## Entry Confirmation
- Enter only after a sharp, statistically stretched move away from a short-term average (e.g. well below a 10-20 day moving average or a clear oversold reading) inside an otherwise range-bound or uptrending backdrop
- Require an early reversal signal (a stall in selling pressure, a bullish intraday reversal candle) before entering — never catch a falling price with no confirmation
- Do not fade a strong, news-driven directional trend

## Position Sizing
- Smaller-than-standard size per trade, since this strategy trades more frequently
- Cap aggregate mean-reversion exposure well within the account's configured max deployed capital
- Never add to a position that has moved further against the reversion thesis

## Exits
- Target a return to the recent average (e.g. the 10-20 day moving average or prior consolidation zone); take profit there rather than waiting for a full round-trip
- Stop loss just beyond the recent extreme low/high that defined the setup
- Time-based exit: close the trade if the expected reversion has not begun within a few trading sessions

## Time Horizon
- Short-horizon swings, typically 1-10 trading days
- Not a buy-and-hold approach — flatten and look for the next setup once the reversion plays out

## No-Trade Conditions
- No entries during a confirmed strong trend with no sign of exhaustion
- No entries within a day of a major scheduled macro release (rate decisions, inflation prints) that could invalidate the setup
- If the "stretch" is not statistically unusual relative to recent history, skip the trade

## Hard Risk Discipline
- Exit immediately if price makes a new extreme beyond the stop — do not average into a worsening reversion trade

## Universe & Liquidity
- Broad market index ETFs and major sector/style ETFs only (highest liquidity tier)
- No single-name equities, no leveraged or inverse products

## Entry Confirmation
- Rotate into a sector or index only when multiple macro signals agree on the regime (e.g. relative strength trend, breadth, rate direction) — a single signal is not sufficient confirmation
- Prefer adding to a position in the direction of an already-established regime over predicting a turn early

## Position Sizing
- Hold a small number of core positions (typically 2-5) sized to the account's configured max position size
- Rebalance gradually — resize an existing position rather than fully exiting and re-entering on minor regime wobbles

## Exits
- Reduce or exit a position when the macro thesis that justified it is invalidated by the signals that originally confirmed it, not on ordinary daily noise
- Use a wide, regime-level stop (well below normal swing-trade stops) consistent with the multi-week/multi-month holding period

## Time Horizon
- Weeks to months per rotation; this strategy is not for short-term trading
- Reassess the full basket on a regular cadence rather than reacting to every session

## No-Trade Conditions
- No rotation on a single day's price action alone
- No new positions immediately ahead of a major scheduled macro event without an already-established thesis
- If macro signals are mixed or conflicting, hold the existing allocation rather than forcing a rotation

## Hard Risk Discipline
- Never let a single sector/index position grow past the account's configured max position size through drift without rebalancing

## Universe & Liquidity
- Liquid large-cap stocks and broad index ETFs with an established, multi-month price history

## Entry Confirmation
- Enter only when price is in a durable uptrend confirmed across multiple timeframes (e.g. price above a rising long-term moving average, higher highs and higher lows over months)
- Prefer adding on confirmed pullbacks within the trend over chasing new highs

## Position Sizing
- Standard position sized to the account's configured max position size, built gradually rather than all at once
- Diversify across a handful of uncorrelated trends rather than concentrating in one theme

## Exits
- Exit or trim only when the long-term trend itself breaks (e.g. a sustained close below the long-term trend average), not on short-term pullbacks
- Use a wide trailing stop appropriate to a multi-month holding period — this strategy is designed to sit through normal volatility

## Time Horizon
- Multi-month to multi-quarter holds; this is the slowest-moving strategy in the catalog
- Review core positions on a weekly, not daily, cadence

## No-Trade Conditions
- No new entries into a name that has already round-tripped through the same range multiple times without a clean breakout
- No entries against the dominant long-term trend
- If no name in the universe shows a durable trend, hold cash rather than force a position

## Universe & Liquidity
- Liquid large-cap stocks and their options with an active, tradable reaction to a specific, verifiable catalyst (earnings release, guidance update, major confirmed headline)
- Confirm the news through a tool call before acting — never trade on an assumed or unverified headline

## Entry Confirmation
- Enter only after the catalyst is public and the market's initial directional reaction is visible in price and volume — never position ahead of a scheduled release on a guess
- Require the move to be liquid enough to enter and exit cleanly (tight spread, active volume in the relevant options or shares)

## Position Sizing
- Smaller-than-standard size given the elevated volatility around catalyst events
- One position per catalyst; do not stack multiple catalyst trades in the same name

## Exits
- Take profit as the initial reaction move matures — this strategy captures the reaction, not any multi-week trend that may follow
- Hard stop if price reverses back through the pre-reaction level, invalidating the catalyst thesis
- Exit by end of the session if the reaction has not developed as expected

## Time Horizon
- Intraday to a few trading days per position — this is a short-hold, event-driven strategy
- Do not convert a failed catalyst trade into a longer-term hold to avoid taking the loss

## No-Trade Conditions
- No pre-positioning ahead of a scheduled earnings release or known event based on speculation
- No trading a headline that has not been confirmed through a tool call
- No trading illiquid options chains just because the underlying had news

## Hard Risk Discipline

## Universe & Liquidity
- Liquid, large-cap optionable names and index/ETF options with tight spreads and meaningful open interest
- Avoid illiquid strikes and wide-spread chains where the premium paid is eaten by slippage

## Entry Confirmation
- Enter only on a specific, statable thesis for an expected move — a directional view, an anticipated volatility expansion, or a confirmed catalyst ahead
- Only long calls or long puts, bought to open — never a written, sold-to-open, or multi-leg spread position
- Prefer strikes and expirations liquid enough to exit at any time without forcing a fill

## Position Sizing
- Size each position so the full premium paid — the maximum possible loss on the trade — stays within the account's configured max position size
- Because every long option can go to zero, never treat one long-premium trade as a substitute for a diversified allocation

## Exits
- Take profit systematically as the position captures its intended move — long premium erodes with time, so do not hold for a "better" exit once the thesis has played out
- Exit or roll before the position enters the steep theta-decay window into expiration if the thesis has not yet resolved
- Cut the position if the thesis is invalidated, even before a stop-loss percentage is hit — a broken thesis on a decaying asset only gets more expensive to hold

## Time Horizon
- Days to a few weeks per position, sized to the expected timeline of the move being traded
- Not a buy-and-forget strategy — decay makes inactivity itself a risk

## No-Trade Conditions
- No selling options to open (no covered calls, no cash-secured puts, no naked or spread positions of any kind)
- No buying options so close to expiration that theta decay dominates the trade before the thesis can play out, unless the strategy explicitly calls for a short-dated catalyst trade
- If the implied volatility already prices in the expected move at a level that makes the risk/reward unfavorable, skip the trade
